## **ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èWhat is EFS?**

*üëâAmazon Elastic File System (EFS) is a scalable, cloud-native file storage service offered by AWS. It provides a simple, managed file storage solution for workloads that require file-level access, making it ideal for use cases such as web serving, content management, data sharing, and backup.*

### **üëâKey Features:**

1. **Fully Managed**: EFS is fully managed, meaning AWS handles all the backend infrastructure, scaling, and maintenance.
    
2. **Scalable**: It automatically scales to accommodate growing storage needs without manual intervention.
    
3. **Accessible**: EFS supports concurrent access from multiple EC2 instances and on-premises servers, allowing for highly available and redundant storage.
    
4. **Performance Modes**: EFS offers two performance modes:
    
    * **General Purpose**: Suitable for most workloads with low-latency requirements.
        
    * **Max I/O**: Designed for workloads that require high throughput and scale.
        
5. **Storage Classes**:
    
    * **Standard**: Ideal for frequently accessed data.
        
    * **Infrequent Access (IA)**: Cost-effective storage for less frequently accessed data.
        
6. **Durability and Availability**: EFS is designed for 99.99% availability and durability by storing data across multiple availability zones.
    
7. **Security**: Integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), VPC, and provides encryption at rest and in transit.
    

### üëâUse Cases:

* **Content Management Systems (CMS)**: Store and serve media and content to users.
    
* **Big Data Analytics**: Share large datasets across instances for processing.
    
* **Application Hosting**: Use EFS for web applications that need shared storage.
    
* **Backup and Recovery**: Store backups with high availability.
    

### üëâKey Benefits:

* **Elasticity**: Automatically scales storage as data grows.
    
* **Cost-Effective**: Pay only for what you use, and use storage classes to optimize costs.
    
* **Integration**: Easy integration with other AWS services like EC2, Lambda, and CloudTrail.
    

## **üëâHow to Mount an AWS EFS to Multiple EC2 Instances ?**

## **Prerequisites**

* **AWS EC2 Instances:** Multiple Ubuntu instances configured in the same VPC as the EFS.
    
* **EFS Created:** An Elastic File System set up in the AWS Management Console.
    
* **Local Linux Machine:** Used to manage and mount the EFS to EC2 instances.
    

## **Steps to Mount EFS on AWS EC2 Instances**

### **Step 1: Switch to Root User**

*  
;)This command switches to the root user to ensure you have the necessary privileges to install packages and modify the filesystem.*

### **Step 2: Navigate to the Root Directory**

### **Step 3: Create a Directory for Mounting the EFS**

Creates a new directory named `efs` at the root level. This directory will serve as the mount point for your EFS.

### ***Step 4: Install Amazon EFS Utilities***

* *Installs the EFS utilities required to mount and manage EFS volumes.*
    
* `yum` *is the package manager used in Amazon Linux; for Ubuntu, use* `apt`*:*

### **Step 5: Attach the EFS**

#### In the AWS Console:

1. Navigate to the **EFS dashboard**.
    
2. Select your EFS and click the **Attach** button.
    
3. Choose **Mount via DNS** (recommended for flexibility and ease of use).
    

#### **Copy the "Using the NFS Client" Command**

The console provides a command similar to the one below. It mounts the EFS using its DNS endpoint.

### **Step 6: Mount the EFS Using the NFS Client**

**  
Command Breakdown:**

* `mount`: Mounts a filesystem.
    
* `-t nfs4`: Specifies the NFS version (NFS v4.1) for compatibility and performance.
    
* `-o`: Specifies mount options:
    
    * `nfsvers=4.1`: Uses NFS version 4.1.
        
    * `rsize=1048576`**,** `wsize=1048576`: Set the read/write buffer sizes to 1 MB for optimal performance.
        
    * `hard`: Ensures retries persist if the server becomes unavailable.
        
    * `timeo=600`: Sets a timeout of 600 deciseconds (60 seconds) for retries.
        
    * `retrans=2`: Limits the number of retries to 2.
        
    * `noresvport`: Disables the use of a reserved port.
        
* [`fs-0f69aa5e27936dc87.efs.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com`](http://fs-0f69aa5e27936dc87.efs.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com)`:/`: The DNS name of the EFS file system.
    
* `efs`: The local directory where the EFS is mounted.
    

## **Verification**

### **Check the Mounted Filesystem**

* Displays the mounted filesystems, showing the EFS under the `/efs` directory.
    

### **Test Write and Read Operations**

1. Create a test file:

## **Advantages of Mounting via DNS**

* **Flexibility:** The DNS endpoint adjusts to changes in the EFS configuration.
    
* **High Availability:** Ensures reliable access to the EFS from multiple availability zones.
    
* **Ease of Use:** Simplifies the mounting process without needing static IPs.
