**ü§îWHAT IS PEERING**

VPC peering is a networking connection between two Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) that enables communication between instances in different VPCs as if they were within the same network. This allows resources in one VPC to securely communicate with resources in another VPC using private IP addresses.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Private Connectivity**: VPC peering allows private IP addresses in both VPCs to communicate without needing a VPN or the internet.
    
2. **Transitive Peering Not Supported**: Communication can only happen directly between the peered VPCs. A VPC cannot reach a third VPC through a peering connection.
    
3. **VPC Peering Limitations**:
    
    * VPCs must exist within the same region or across regions (in the case of inter-region VPC peering).
        
    * Peering relationships are one-to-one (i.e., only two VPCs can be directly connected via a single peering connection).
        
    * VPC CIDR blocks must not overlap.
        
4. **Routing**: Once peered, you must update the route tables in each VPC to allow traffic to flow between them.
    
5. **Security**: VPC peering does not affect security groups or network ACLs. You must configure security groups and ACLs to allow traffic between instances in peered VPCs.
    

### Use Cases:

* **Cross-Region Communication**: Connecting VPCs in different regions to enable global applications.
    
* **Multiple Accounts**: Peering VPCs across different AWS accounts to allow secure resource sharing.
    
* **Centralized Services**: Connecting multiple VPCs to a central VPC that contains shared resources or services (like DNS or centralized databases).
    

### How to Set Up VPC Peering:

1. **Create a Peering Connection**: Initiate a peering connection request from one VPC to another.
    
2. **Accept the Request**: The owner of the second VPC must accept the peering connection request.
    
3. **Update Route Tables**: Add routes to each VPC's route table to allow traffic to flow between the peered VPCs.
    
4. **Modify Security Groups and NACLs**: Ensure the security settings allow traffic between instances in both VPCs.
    

# **Step 1: Create Peering Connections**

To create a peering connection between VPC A and VPC B:

1. Navigate to the VPC dashboard then scroll down and select ‚Äú**Peering connections**‚Äù from the left-hand side menu.
    
2. Click on the ‚ÄúCreate peering connection‚Äù button.

Peering Connections Dashboard

In the ‚ÄúPeering connection settings‚Äù section, enter the following information in the available fields:

* **Name ‚Äî Optional:** VPC A &lt;-&gt; VPC B
    
* **Select a local VPC to peer with &lt;VPC ID Requester&gt;:** Select VPC A from the drop-down list
    
* **Select another VPC to peer with**: Account ‚Äî My Account, Region ‚Äî This Region
    
* **VPC ID (Acceptor)**: Select VPC B from the drop-down list
    

Click on the **Create peering connection** button.

Create a Peering Connection Between VPC A and VPC B

Next, we are taken to a confirmation page indicating that the peering connection between VPC A and VPC B has been requested and is in a **‚ÄúPending acceptance‚Äù** state. Click on the ‚ÄúActions‚Äù button and click on Accept Request from the drop-down menu in order to complete the peering connection request between the two VPCs.

Peering Connection VPC A &lt;-&gt; VPC B request

**To create a peering connection between VPC A and VPC C:**

Repeat the previous steps to create a peering connection between VPC A and VPC C. Enter the following information into the available fields:

* **Name ‚Äî optional**: VPC A &lt;-&gt; VPC C
    
* **Select a local VPC to peer with &lt;VPC ID (Requestor)&gt;:** Select VPC A from the drop-down list
    
* **Select another VPC to peer with:** Account ‚Äî My account, Region ‚Äî This Region
    
* **VPC ID (Acceptor):** Select VPC C from the drop-down list
    

Click on the orange **Create peering connection** button.

Peering connections dashboard

At this point, we should see that both peering connections have been successfully established between the VPCs for which they‚Äôve been created.

# **2\. Update Route Tables**

In the next step, you will update each route table with entries to direct any outbound inter-VPC network traffic to the VPC peering connection (pcx) that has been established with the remote VPC that needs to receive traffic. From the left-hand side menu, select ‚Äú**Route tables**‚Äù to reach the Route tables dashboard.

**Update VPC A Route Table:**

From the dashboard, select the route table named ‚Äú**VPC A Route Table**‚Äù and then click on the **Edit routes** button at the bottom.

Edit Route Table of VPC A

On the next screen, click on the ‚ÄúAdd route‚Äù button to add a new route to the route table that will be used for sending traffic to the VPC B network.

Save changes to VPC C Route Table

This completes the updates to the route tables for each of the 3 VPCs that were deployed in this demonstration. In the final step, it is a good idea to test network connectivity between the resources that were deployed in each VPC.

## **Step 3: Test Network Connectivity**

The final step of the VPC Peering exercise is to validate that inter-VPC network connectivity is enabled. This can be accomplished by initiating ICMP ping request from the EC2 instance of a VPC network and sending that request to an EC2 instance or other resource within another VPC.

* **EC2-VPC A IP: 10.0.0.25**
    
* **EC2 VPC B IP: 10.1.0.236**
    
* **EC2 VPC C IP: 10.2.0.173**
    

From the EC2 instance that was deployed in VPC A, I initiated a continuous ping request to the EC2 instance that was deployed in VPC B at IP address 10.1.0.236. This network connectivity was successful as indicated by the ping replies that were received back from the EC2 of VPC B.

I then repeated this test to send ping requests to the EC2 instance that was deployed in the VPC C at IP address 10.2.0.173. This connectivity test was successful as indicated by the ping replies that were received from the EC2 of VPC C and there was 0% packet loss!!!

ICMP ping connectivity testing from the EC2 of VPC A to the EC2s in both VPC B and VPC C were successful! These destination hosts are reachable from my EC2 instance of the VPC A network!!

Next, I initiated an ICMP ping test from the EC2 instance of VPC B to the EC2 instance of VPC C. Look at that! The network connectivity testing fails this time with 100% packet loss!!

**Can you guess why this host in VPC C is unreachable when initiating the request from the EC2 instance of VPC B?**
