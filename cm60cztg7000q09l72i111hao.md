Load balancing is the distribution of workloads across multiple servers to ensure consistent and optimal resource utilization. It is an essential aspect of any large-scale and scalable computing system, as it helps you to improve the reliability and performance of your applications.

**Load balancing can help you to achieve the following benefits:**

* **High availability**: Load balancing can prevent your applications from becoming unavailable due to server failures or overloading. By distributing the traffic across multiple servers, load balancing can ensure that your applications can handle the requests even if one or more servers go down or become slow.
    
* **Fault tolerance**: Load balancing can also help you to recover from server failures or errors. By detecting the unhealthy or unresponsive servers, load balancing can automatically redirect the traffic to the healthy or available servers, minimizing the impact on your applications and users.
    
* **Scalability**: Load balancing can also help you to scale your applications according to the demand or traffic. By adding or removing servers from the load balancing pool, you can adjust the capacity and performance of your applications without affecting the user experience.
    

# **What is Elastic Load Balancing?**

  
**Elastic Load Balancing (ELB**) is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances. ELB provides three types of load balancers:

* **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: ALB operates at layer 7 of the OSI model and is ideal for applications that require advanced routing and microservices. ALB can route the traffic based on the content of the request, such as the URL path, the host header, the query parameters, etc. ALB can also support multiple protocols, such as HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP/2, WebSocket, and gRPC. ALB can also integrate with other AWS services, such as Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, AWS Lambda, AWS WAF, etc.
    
* **Network Load Balancer (NLB):** NLB operates at layer 4 of the OSI model and is ideal for applications that require high throughput and low latency. NLB can route the traffic based on the TCP or UDP port and the IP address of the destination. NLB can also support static or elastic IP addresses, long-lived TCP connections, and TLS termination. NLB can also integrate with other AWS services, such as Amazon VPC, Amazon EC2, AWS CloudFormation, etc.
    
* **Classic Load Balancer (CLB):** CLB operates at layer 4 of the OSI model and is ideal for applications that require basic load balancing features. CLB can route the traffic based on the TCP or SSL port and the IP address of the destination. CLB can also support HTTP, HTTPS, SSL, and TCP protocols, health checks, sticky sessions, and cross-zone load balancing. CLB can also integrate with other AWS services, such as Amazon EC2, Amazon CloudWatch, etc.
    

# **üëâHow to Launch Two EC2 Instances with an Ubuntu AMI and Use User Data to Install the Apache Web Server**

4\. Choose an existing key pair or create a new one if you don‚Äôt have one already. You‚Äôll need this key pair to SSH into your instance later.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/0*7UMzF7m8xIgrpPvO.png align="left")

5\. In the **Configure Instance Details** page, scroll down to the **Advanced Details** section and expand the **User data** field.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/0*ylcUltd01g_FbB34.png align="left")

6\. In the **User data** field, enter the following commands to install and start the Apache Web Server:

```plaintext
#!/bin/bash
# Update packages
sudo apt-get update -y
# Install Apache
sudo apt-get install -y apache2
# Start Apache service
sudo systemctl start apache2
# Enable Apache service
sudo systemctl enable apache2
# Modify index.html file
sudo echo "<h1>Welcome to AWS EC2</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
sudo echo "<p>My name is Ajit</p>" >> /var/www/html/index.html
```

7\. Expand Network settings**:** Create a new security group or select an existing one. Make sure to allow inbound traffic on port 80 for HTTP protocol from anywhere. This will allow us to access the Apache web page from our browser.

8\. Click on **Launch instance** button and wait for your instance to launch.

9\. Repeat steps 2‚Äì8 to launch another instance with the same configuration, but modify the user data script as follows:

```plaintext
#!/bin/bash
# Update packages
sudo apt-get update -y
# Install Apache
sudo apt-get install -y apache2
# Start Apache service
sudo systemctl start apache2
# Enable Apache service
sudo systemctl enable apache2
# Modify index.html file
sudo echo "<h1>Welcome to AWS EC2</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
sudo echo "<p>TrainWithShubham Community is Super Awesome :)</p>" >> /var/www/html/index.html
```

This will change the message in the index.html file for the second instance.

You have successfully launched two EC2 instances with an Ubuntu AMI and used User Data to install the Apache Web Server.

# **ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èHow to Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in EC2 using the AWS Management Console and Add the EC2 Instances to the ALB as Target Groups**

An Application Load Balancer (ALB) is a type of load balancer that operates at layer 7 of the OSI model and is ideal for applications that require advanced routing and microservices. ALB can route the traffic based on the content of the request, such as the URL path, the host header, the query parameters, etc. ALB can also support multiple protocols, such as HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP/2, WebSocket, and gRPC. ALB can also integrate with other AWS services, such as Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, AWS Lambda, AWS WAF, etc.

üëâTo create an ALB in EC2 using the AWS Management Console and add the EC2 instances to the ALB as target groups, we‚Äôll use the following steps:

1.Go to the AWS console and navigate to the EC2 service.

8\. Click on the **Create load balancer** button and wait for your load balancer to be created.

You have successfully created an ALB in EC2 using the AWS Management Console and added the EC2 instances to the ALB as target groups.

# **ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èHow to Verify that the ALB is Working Properly by Checking the Health Status of the Target Instances and Testing the Load Balancing Capabilities**

To verify that the ALB is working properly, we‚Äôll use the following steps:

1.Go to the AWS console and navigate to the EC2 service.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/0*yAxcOQuBhry7KoBc.png align="left")

2\. Click on **Load Balancers** in the left navigation pane and select your load balancer, such as **ALB-Demo**.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/0*A0qWb2M6e94iRneZ.png align="left")

3\. Copy the DNS name of your load balancer from the details panel. This is the address that you can use to access your load balancer from your browser.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/0*pwWtm3hI7vvlzzhy.png align="left")

4\. Open a web browser and paste the DNS name into the address bar.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/0*-f42W0zItcqZ9OtC.png align="left")

5\. Refresh the web page several times and observe the changes. You should see different names or messages on each refresh, such as ‚ÄúWelcome to AWS EC2‚Äù . This means that the load balancer is distributing the traffic across your two EC2 instances and displaying the index.html file from each instance.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/0*iV7YHGkc6E4Wl-nr.png align="left")

6\. Go back to the AWS console and navigate to the EC2 service.

7\. Click on **Target Groups** in the left navigation pane and select your target group, such as **ALB-Demo-TG**.

8\. Click on the **Targets** tab and observe the health status of your target instances. You should see that both instances are healthy and in service. This means that the load balancer is able to communicate with your instances and perform health checks on them.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/0*AJIsyv1RwukXgTV7.png align="left")

9\. To test the fault tolerance of your load balancer, you can stop or terminate one of your instances and see how the load balancer handles the situation. For example, you can select one of your instances, such as **ALB-Demo-1**, and click on **Actions** button and choose **Instance State** and then **Stop** or **Terminate** option from the drop-down menu.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/0*Z6ZiRMNSTQT1Ev4L.png align="left")

10\. Wait for the instance to stop or terminate and then refresh the web page in your browser. You should see that the web page is still accessible and displaying the name or message from the other instance, such as ‚ÄúWelcome to AWS EC2‚Äù . This means that the load balancer is able to detect the unhealthy or unavailable instance and redirect the traffic to the healthy or available instance.
