### **Overview**  
Create a highly available and scalable web application using Elastic Load Balancer(ELB).

### **Introduction**  
One of the advantages of working with the cloud is autoscaling, which automatically changes your infrastructure and resources to meet the current level of demand. Another advantage is load balancing which is needed to help control and regulate the traffic demanding your resources. Having a web application with these features makes room for optimal performance and efficiency so walk with me let's create one together.

**AWS Ec2 Instance for Web Application**  
AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a service that provides scalable and reliable computing resources for web applications.

**Prerequisite**

1. An AWS account
    
2. Basic knowledge of VPC and subnet
    
3. Script for the web application
    

### **ðŸ‘‰Step 1: Create your Servers using AWS EC2 service**  
i. Use the search bar to search for Ec2 and click on it.

ii. Create 2 servers for the two subnets you created by clicking on launch instance

iii. Set the name of your first server and leave everything after as default until you get to network settings where you select the VPC you created and select one subnet out of the two you created.

iv. After network settings set your security group inbound details to SSH from anywhere and HTTP from anywhere because we are working with a public subnet

v. Leave everything after the security group as default and once you get to Advanced details select it and scroll down to user data, this is where you input the script for your web application and then click on launch instance.

### **Conclusion**

**In conclusion, Load Balancing are important concepts that every cloud/DevOps Engineer or individual learning cloud computing needs to know due to the value they bring to any Cloud project.**

**Load balancing helps to navigate, control and balance the traffic coming into an infrastructure to ensure smooth flow. From the explanation, it is a must-know and should be applied while creating your infrastructure so the steps highlighted above should be carefully followed when implementing load balancing.**
