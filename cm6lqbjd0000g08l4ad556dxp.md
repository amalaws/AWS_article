## üëâIntroduction

In modern web applications, security is a crucial factor. One of the key aspects of security is encrypting data transmission using **SSL/TLS certificates**. AWS provides **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)** to simplify the process of provisioning, managing, and deploying SSL/TLS certificates in AWS services.

## üëâWhat is AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)?

AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) is a managed service that allows users to request, provision, and renew **SSL/TLS certificates** without the need for manual intervention. It enables secure communication over the internet by encrypting data between clients and servers.

## üëåFeatures of ACM

* **Automated Certificate Management**: ACM handles renewal, deployment, and revocation automatically.
    
* **Free Public Certificates**: ACM provides free SSL/TLS certificates for use with AWS services.
    
* **Integration with AWS Services**: Works seamlessly with **Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), Amazon CloudFront, and API Gateway**.
    
* **Private Certificate Issuance**: ACM also supports issuing private certificates using **AWS Private Certificate Authority (CA)**.
    

## üëâTypes of Certificates in ACM

1. **Public Certificates**: Issued by AWS at no cost and can be used with AWS-integrated services.
    
2. **Private Certificates**: Managed by AWS Private CA, useful for internal applications.
    
3. **Imported Certificates**: Third-party certificates that can be manually uploaded to ACM.
    

## How to Request an SSL/TLS Certificate in ACM

To request an SSL/TLS certificate in ACM:

1. **Open the AWS ACM Console**
    
2. Click on **Request a Certificate**
    
3. Choose **Request a public certificate**
    
4. Enter the domain names (e.g., [`example.com`](http://example.com), [`www.example.com`](http://www.example.com))
    
5. Select a validation method (**DNS validation** or **Email validation**)
    
6. Review and submit the request
    
7. Validate the certificate using the selected method
    
8. Once validated, the certificate is issued and ready for use
    

## Deploying ACM Certificates

### Using Elastic Load Balancer (ELB):

* Navigate to **EC2 Dashboard** &gt; **Load Balancers**
    
* Select your load balancer and go to the **Listeners** tab
    
* Click **Edit** and select **ACM Certificate**
    
* Choose the certificate and apply changes
    

### Using Amazon CloudFront:

* Navigate to **CloudFront Console**
    
* Select a distribution and go to **Edit Settings**
    
* Under **SSL Certificate**, choose an ACM certificate
    
* Save changes to apply the certificate
    

### Using API Gateway:

* Open **API Gateway Console**
    
* Select an API and navigate to **Custom Domain Names**
    
* Attach an ACM-issued certificate
    

## Renewing and Managing Certificates

* **ACM automatically renews public certificates** before expiration.
    
* For imported certificates, users need to manually renew and upload them.
    
* You can track certificate status using the **ACM Console** or **AWS CLI**.
    

## ‚ö°Best Practices for SSL/TLS in ACM

* Use **DNS validation** for automatic renewals.
    
* Regularly monitor **certificate expiration dates**.
    
* Use **private certificates** for internal applications to enhance security.
    
* Implement **AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)** along with SSL/TLS for better security.
